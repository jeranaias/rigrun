## Problem description

<!--
Explain the problem you're facing or the limitation you've encountered.
Focus on *what* is difficult or impossible to do with rigrun today, rather than the solution.
Include any relevant technical details (e.g., routing behavior, model selection, latency, privacy, offline behavior).
-->

## Proposed solution

<!--
Describe the feature or change you'd like to see in rigrun.
Be as specific as possible:
- What should the API / CLI / config look like?
- How should it behave at runtime?
- How should it interact with existing routing or local-first guarantees?
If helpful, include short code or config snippets.
-->

## Alternatives considered

<!--
List any alternative approaches or workarounds you've tried or considered.
Explain why they are not sufficient for your use case (e.g., too complex, brittle, poor performance, breaks local-first constraints).
-->

## Use case

<!--
Describe the real-world scenario where this feature would be used.
Who is the user (e.g., application developer, ops engineer, researcher)?
What workflow or product does this enable or simplify?
If applicable, mention the environment (local-only, hybrid local+cloud, edge devices, etc.).
-->

## Priority / impact

<!--
How important is this feature to you, and what is the impact if it's missing?
Choose one and optionally elaborate:

- Blocker: Cannot adopt rigrun or continue using it without this.
- High: Major friction; requires significant workarounds.
- Medium: Noticeable improvement; current setup is acceptable but suboptimal.
- Low: Nice-to-have; incremental improvement.
-->

**Priority level:**
_Blocker / High / Medium / Low_ (pick one)

**Impact details (optional):**
<!-- e.g., "Would reduce infra costs by ~X%", "Enables new product feature Y", "Removes complex custom routing logic" -->

## Additional context

<!--
Add any other context, references, or links that might help:
- Related GitHub issues or discussions
- Design docs or architecture diagrams
- Logs / metrics / benchmarks illustrating the problem
- Constraints (security, compliance, on-device resource limits, etc.)
